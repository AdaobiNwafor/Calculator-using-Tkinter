# Calculator-using-Tkinter

My first **GUI App**. The calculator was made using **TKinter**. Working with the interface was challenging but exciting. The calculator **contains an 'Addition', 'Subtraction', 'Multiplication', 'Division', 'Equals' and 'Clear' button. It is a fully functional app** and I'm happy to have worked on this project.
